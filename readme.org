* harfbuzz-fonts

my own version of [[https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz-wasm-examples][harfbuzz/harfbuzz-wasm-examples]], with some fonts.
contains some directories copied directly from that repo:

- =bin= contains some helpful binaries, like otfsurgeon
- =base-fonts= contains the base .ttf files
- =harfbuzz-wasm= contains the rust crate with harfbuzz bindings

** fonts:
- =roman-numerals= displays numbers in roman numerals

** building
each font directory contains a =Makefile=, so you can build the font by running =make=

you can use a tool like FontGoggles (built with wasm harfbuzz support) to visualize the font.
the original repo has a build for m1 macs
