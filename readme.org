my own version of [[https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz-wasm-examples][harfbuzz/harfbuzz-wasm-examples]], with some fonts.
contains some directories copied directly from that repo:

- =bin= contains some helpful binaries, like otfsurgeon
- =base-fonts= contains the base .ttf files
- =harfbuzz-wasm= contains the rust crate with harfbuzz bindings
